## defipricebot

defipricebot is an open source Twitter bot that provides snapshots of prices gathered via web3, currently running every eight hours.

It uses the latest round pricing data as provided by Chainlink.

It is also queryable for on-demand price data of certain major assets. See below for use.

### Easter Eggs
